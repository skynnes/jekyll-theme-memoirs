This website is a example where **Memoirs Jekyll theme** has been used to create a simple, fast and easy static blog. The theme is compatible with Github pages, in fact even this demo itself is created with Github Pages and hosted with Github. In my case it's hosted with AWS S3 and fronted by cloudfront.
